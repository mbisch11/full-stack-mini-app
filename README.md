# TODO

 - Make it so that there's only one MealPlan/Grocery List per day
   - If the day isn't the same on read, clear the list
   - Managed through the client side, not the server
 - Make sure the client side only reads from the existing list
   - Frontend only creates new list if grocery list/meal plan if fetching existing one returns id of -1 

>  - Update backend as needed
>  - May need to add more updates/deletes
